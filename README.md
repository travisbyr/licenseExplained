# GitHub License's Explained

<h3>MIT License</h3>

The MIT license is a free license that applies minimal restrictions to a piece of work. This license is often used with open-source software as it allows others to create and modify the piece of work. The MIT License is classed as a 'permissive license' as it has very little restrictions for the use of the work. With this license, the work provided is 'as is' meaning the author cannot be held liable for any damages.

<h3>The Unlicense</h3>

The Unlicense is a license that disclaims copyright with the associated piece of work. This is a public domain license meaning it waives the creators rights to the associated piece of work. This license gives all users freedom to do whatever they want to the piece of work. This includes modifying, copying, selling, distributing for commercial or non-commercial reasons.  Essentially this means that the work does not have a license, so it follows the copyright protection act, disabling others from using the work without a license.

<h3>Apache License 2.0</h3>

The Apache License (ver 2.0) is a permissive free license created by the Apache Foundation. Because this license is permissive free, this means that users can modify and distribute the work in its original or modified form. Depending on the damages caused by the work, creators can be held liable for any damages caused due to the creation of the work. Their are also restrictions describing the allowances of using the contributors name, trademarks and logos.

<h3>Mozilla Public License 2.0</h3>

The Mozilla Public License (ver 2.0) is a permissive free license maintained by Mozilla. This license is used with open-source work as the license allows users to modify and distribute the work.  Similarly to the Apache License, creators can be held liable for damages caused by the creation of their work. Their are also restrictions describing the allowances of using the contributors name, trademarks and logos.
